USAGE
=====

server mode with PCIe card, transmit/receive on channel 2 
	./spw_bridge -c 2

server mode with Brick MK II (channel is always 1), configure speed for link 2,
send packets via route with id 2 (== link 2) to remote SpW device with node addr
0x14:

	./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 2:14 -L 2

client mode, connect to localhost:1234, same configuration otherwise:

	./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 2:14 -L 2 -r localhost:1234


USE in CHEOPS EGSE:
===================

1) real DPU connected to CrSem via ...

** BRICK Link 1:
./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 01:24:00:00:00 -d 4 -L 1 -p 5573 -P

** BRICK Link 2:
./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 02:24:00:00:00 -d 4 -L 2 -p 5573 -P

Note, that the first byte in the route is used by the brick (link number).
The next one is the address of the DPU (24) and the remaining 3 are
eaten by the DPU.

the -d 4 drops the 4 byte SpW address header, which is attached by the real DPU.


GRESB protocol with grmon2 for RMAP access
==========================================

1) connect target spw link to a SpW port which supports RMAP on the target
   machine; in the GR712, only link 0 or link 1 support RMAP
2) start spw_bridge with gresb option, make sure to choose a proper divider
   for 10 MHz link speed; e.g. channel 1, base clock == 200 -> div =20
   $ ./spw_bridge -c 1 -D 20 -G
3) the GRESB uses a base port number of 3000 + offset for tx/rx link selected
   grmon2 wants to use the interface in this manner, so we use socat to forward
   all packets to the actual port of spw_bridge (default 1234)
   $ socat tcp-l:3000,fork,reuseaddr tcp:127.0.0.1:1234
   $ socat tcp-l:3001,fork,reuseaddr tcp:127.0.0.1:1234

4) start grmon with gresb target and IP of machine which runs spw_bridge, e.g.
   $ grmon -gresb 127.0.0.1

5) there's a caveat to this: the GRSPW2 SpW port may not be initialised if
   there is no boot prom present;
   for the GR712, you'll have to first connect via the JTAG or other debug
   interface and set up a core, e.g. GRSPW0:
   wmem 0x80100800 0xA0010006
   wmem 0x8010080C 0x00000909
