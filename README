USAGE
=====

server mode with PCIe card, transmit/receive on channel 2 
	./spw_bridge -c 2

server mode with Brick MK II (channel is always 1), configure speed for link 2,
send packets via route with id 2 (== link 2) to remote SpW device with node addr
0x14:

	./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 2:14 -L 2

client mode, connect to localhost:1234, same configuration otherwise:

	./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 2:14 -L 2 -r localhost:1234


USE in CHEOPS EGSE:
===================

1) real DPU connected to CrSem via ...

** BRICK Link 1:
./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 01:24:00:00:00 -d 4 -L 1 -p 5573 -P

** BRICK Link 2:
./spw_bridge -c 1 -n 02:24:00:00:00 -d 4 -L 2 -p 5573 -P

Note, that the first byte in the route is used by the brick (link number).
The next one is the address of the DPU (24) and the remaining 3 are
eaten by the DPU.

the -d 4 drops the 4 byte SpW address header, which is attached by the real DPU.
